_____________Bio_____________
As a Computer Engineering major and coding enthusiast,
I've enjoyed using GitHub where I can. Speaking of coding,
I first got into programming in _middle school_! I first started
off with JavaScript and some HTML, but today, my favorite
languages are C++, Python, and MATLAB.
